It doesn't matter if the barrel is clogged with cinder blocks from crashing thru a building.  It doesn't matter if it is underwater.  It doesn't matter if the rest of the mech is a pool of slag.  With four layers of redundancy circuits and coils, it will always come back home.  The pilot gets that one-good-shot.  However, all that dependability sacrificed the ammo hopper, cooling mechanisms, reloading senoids making it the time between shots seem like an eternity.","flavorDescription":"\"It helps if you lean forward when you're firing.\" - Jessup Borkfur, uncertain engineer.","frontOptionalText":"","buffs":{"activationDescriptors":[{"definition":{"instanceID":6763790},"showBuffOnCard":false,"buffIsPenalty":false,"powerupActivationTarget":0,"powerupActivationScope":0,"powerupActivationTrigger":0,"activationRange":0.0,"activationDuration":0.0,"maxTargets":0,"scriptedActivation":false,"cardDisplayText":"Ammo +1","minLevel":1,"maxLevel":10},{"definition":{"instanceID":6763792},"showBuffOnCard":false,"buffIsPenalty":false,"powerupActivationTarget":0,"powerupActivationScope":0,"powerupActivationTrigger":0,"activationRange":0.0,"activationDuration":0.0,"maxTargets":0,"scriptedActivation":false,"cardDisplayText":"","minLevel":1,"maxLevel":10},{"definition":{"instanceID":6763794},"showBuffOnCard":false,"buffIsPenalty":false,"powerupActivationTarget":0,"powerupActivationScope":0,"powerupActivationTrigger":0,"activationRange":0.0,"activationDuration":0.0,"maxTargets":0,"scriptedActivation":false,"cardDisplayText":"","minLevel":1,"maxLevel":10}],"scriptedActivation":false},"metaData":{"designation":0,"distance":0},"baseCost":{"currencyType":0,"amount":810},"creationCost":10,"trialInfo":{"isTrialItem":false,"purchaseCost":{"currencyType":0,"amount":0},"upgradeCost":{"currencyType":0,"amount":0},"upgradeTarget":0,"usages":0,"duration":0.0},"craftingSpecification":{"componentEntries":[{"designation":111,"componentID":100},{"designation":121,"componentID":111},{"designation":122,"componentID":112},{"designation":112,"componentID":103},{"designation":223,"componentID":114},{"designation":213,"componentID":115},{"designation":314,"componentID":124},{"designation":324,"componentID":134},{"designation":325,"componentID":143}]},"validSlots":[2,3],"equipmentType":20,"storyIdentifier":"","storyQuote":"“These Katma-Fu lessons are probably going to be as useless as armor against a Railcat railgun, right Aspen?  Do we really have to go?” Rainer sighed. - Katma-Fu: Part 1 of 11","ratingNumber":1,"ratingColor":0,"additionalStat":0,"additionalStatValue":70,"modelManager":{"defaultModel":{"gameplayModelResourceLocation":"WorldAppearances/Railguns/OldFaithful Right","previewModelResourceLocation":"","applicableSlot":0},"alternativeModels":[{"gameplayModelResourceLocation":"WorldAppearances/Railguns/Old Faithful Left","previewModelResourceLocation":"","applicableSlot":3}]},"fireButtonImage":5,"iconPrefab":{"instanceID":52402},"displayPriority":1,"fangSlots":0,"fangPowerup":0,"blockchain":{"globalItemId":3,"globalAppId":2,"totalMinted":0,"devWallet":"","name":"","creator":"","icon":"","exchangeRate":0.0,"meltFee":0.0,"maxMeltFee":0.0,"streetValue":0.0,"streetPopularity":0.0,"transferable":true,"_isDirty":false}}
